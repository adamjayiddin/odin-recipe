    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico.
         In Spanish, coquito means "little coconut." The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum. 
         Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with egg yolks, 
        is similar to eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."</p>
