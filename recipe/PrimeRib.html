    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Prime rib is a classic roast beef preparation made from the beef rib primal cut,
        usually roasted with the bone in and served with a simple pan sauce made from its natural juices (au jus).
        The word "prime" is a legal designation that refers to the fact that the beef has been graded prime by the USDA.
        If the meat is not labeled as "prime" then it is simply a standing rib roast, or, if it is boneless, it is a rib-eye roast.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) <b>bone-in prime rib</b> roast (room temperature)</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup unsalted <b>butter</b>, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground <b>black pepper</b></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon <b>herbes de Provence</b></li>
        <li><b>kosher salt</b> to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.
             Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        
        <li>Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended.
             Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast.
             Season roast generously with kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
             (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, 
            let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>

    </ol>
